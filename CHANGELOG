- Semantic versioning


##[Unreleased -> 2.0.1]

## Changed 
 - Wait for JUnit 5.4.0 to implement test method ordering to write proper database tests.


## [2.0.0]

#### Note
	- Development of version 2.0.0 was a bit all over the place. Commits are out of order and the changelog wasn't accuratly tracked.
	Starting now a more tracable documentation and commit behaviour will be enforced.

### Fixed

- Breaking change
	- rename hemming to hamming distance
	- rename getElementsWithinHemmingDistance to getElementsWithinHammingDistance in binaryTree

- Bumped dependency of github.kilianB.UtilityCode to 1.5.0 utilizing the fix in getScaledImage instance which 
would fall back to the old jdk 1 awt implementation decreasing speed by a factor of 600. As well as supporting multiple image types

 - removed unnecessary computation of grayscale image in difference hash
 - difference hash now computes the padding byte correctly
 - Typo in hashing algorithm "bitResoluation" -> "bitResolution". Since this is a protected field
 which most likely is used in any derived hashing algorithm this is classified as a breaking change!
 - Due to a major version bump the dHash will be revisited and it's implementation
 might change to not waste one bit. This will lead to all created hashes so far to be invalidated. The algorithm id of dHash will be updated
 accordingly.

### Changed

- Update JUnit to 5.3.1
- The hashing algorithm was refactored and now has to implement a different method signature returning a big integer instead of a hash object. 
	In preparation to drop the no information 1 padding bit
- Starting with version 2 hashes now use Luminosity as given by YCrCb instead of interpolated grayscale values.
- The bitResolution argument in hashing algorithms now follows the contract that the resulting hash has at least the number of bits specified.. All hash algorithms are updated to follow the earlier mentioned rule. 
  Additionally the precomputation step of images now allows a 1 pixel deviation between width and height to allow for closer matching images.
- Hash classes migrate to use FastPixel access speeding up creation of higher key hashes by magnitude
- test cases to reflect changes
- the algorithm id of each algorithm is altered to reflect incompatibility.
- default image matchers have different thresholds due to changed key precisions returned by default algorithm settings

### Added
 - Minor javadocs addition
 - dependency on UtilityCode com.github.kilianB
 - Hashing algorithms are serializable 
 - Rotational Invariant hasher (RotPHash, Rotational)
 - WIP - Hog-Hash
 - Database image matcher
 - Algorithm Benchmarker
 - add equals and hashcode to image matcher
 - ImageMatcher results now also reference  the normalized distance
 - CummulativeInMemoryMatcher
 - getBit and getBitUnsafe to Hash.java to retrieve individual bits without needing to access the underlaying big integer object. 
 - added tests
 - Add AverageColorHash
 - multiple differen hog variants
 - kernels and filters
